Media Cloud Providers Library
=============================

A package of search providers for Media Cloud, wrapping up interfaces for different social media platform.

UNDER CONSTRUCTION- Probably won't get a huge amount of attention for a little bit, but I'm putting this 
up now since I've done this extraction already.

Install with pip (`pip install .`) and the `install.sh` script. 

Requires environment variables set for various interfaces to work correctly.


### Build

Make sure `pip install flit twine` so you can build and deploy to PyPI.

1. Bump the version number in `pyproject.toml`
2. Run `flit build` to create an installation package
3. Run `twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*` to upload it to PyPI's test platform
4. Run `twine upload dist/*` to upload it to PyPI
